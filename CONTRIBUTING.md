## Cirrus Feeders/Workflows/Tasks

Add a folder to `cirrus-examples` as a container. Take a gander at the `simple-task-workflow` as an example.

- To avoid potential naming conflicts, add a random string to feeder/workflow/task names
- Create a short README.md to describe what the feeders/workflows/tasks do, how to use them, how to verify the workflow has successfully run etc.
